TThis took me a long time and I had to completely relearn JavaScript to make this. This has 115 questions and they can get very hard. I hope you enjoy.

I am still debugging Google fire base/file store so I can get the global hit counter and high score list working. You can help me with that in the meantime with the stats and everything by filling out this short Google form:
